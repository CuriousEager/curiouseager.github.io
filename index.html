    Hi Emma, Erik here again ðŸ¦‹
    <br>Sorry this page looks so shitty, I just quickly set it up.
    <br>I never gave up on trying to reach you and I still want to get in touch again and help with whatever has been happening. This is just another attempt. Hopefully one of them works.
    <br><br>Send me a message with the form below and I should get it. Basically it just sends an email, but it doesn't rely on your email account. I'll try to reply to your email, but if I can't reach you any other way, I'll update this page with a response, so check back!
  </p>

  <form action="http://formspree.io/enmolenaar@gmail.com" method="POST">
    <input type="hidden" name="_subject" value="Contact request from personal website">
    <input type="email" name="_replyto" placeholder="Your email">
    <br><textarea name="message" placeholder="Type your message" required="" style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; height: 300px;"></textarea>
    <br><button type="submit">Send me your message</button>
  </form>
